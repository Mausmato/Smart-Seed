# SmartSeed

As a result of extreme weather resulting from the climate crises, soil conditions are deteriorating. This is devastating to our food's nutrient density, the quantity of crops yielded, and the economy. 

We want to enable communities: big and small, by allowing them to spend less time diagnosing their crop deaths. SmartSeed helps revitalise soil quality by analysing your plants for their deficiencies.

## Lessons Learned

While building this, we developed the ability to use Flask to connect the frontend and backend. Additionally, we strengthened our understanding of fullstack development. Overall, we learned to streamline our projects to best achieve our goals; we cut out unnecessary features to enable the most important ones.


## Features for Next Iteration
